# Strong password generator

This code can generate strong but memorable passwords.  It creates passwords that are three common words and a 4-digit number.  E.g. "PlanetJokerEnrich1002"

Optionally it can swap characters for symbols (e.g. 'a' becomes '@'), and can insert symbols between the words.  Examples are "Jug%Foot&Zephyr^8100" and "C@rd*L@k3!Im@g3^2098"

With the words and numbers alone, there are 1.125 trillion possible passwords it can generate.  With symbol substitution this jumps to 72 trillion.  With symbols between words, it's way more.
