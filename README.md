# Strong password generator

This code can generate strong but memorable passwords.  It creates passwords that are three common words and a 4-digit number.

Optionally it can swap characters for symbols (e.g. 'a' becomes '@'), and can insert symbols between the words.

With the words and numbers alone, there are 1.125 trillion possible passwords it can generate.  With symbol substitution this jumps to 72 trillion.  With symbols between words, it's way more.
